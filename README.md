# MSMinimee

* Author: [John D Wells](http://johndwells.com)
* Requires: [ExpressionEngine 2](http://www.expressionengine.com), [Minimee 2+](http://johndwells.com/software/minimee)

_Minimee 2, which MSMinimee requires, is currently under heavy development; you're welcome to check out progress (or participate) over on [Github](https://github.com/johndwells/Minimee/tree/development)._


## Overview

MSMinimee is an ExpressionEngine Module that makes [Minimee](http://johndwells.com/software/minimee) fully MSM-compatible.  
_This is not a replacement of Minimee_; rather it extends it only where it needs to. This way I can develop the features & functionality of MSM support separate from the core of what Minimee does.


## Installation Instructions

* Be sure Minimee 2+ is present in your system/expressionengine/third_party folder
* Copy the MSMinimee folder into your system/expressionengine/third_party folder
* Visit your Modules page and install MSMinimee


## Tag Usage

Use Minimee as normal, and if you have saved settings for a particular site, those will be used. Otherwise, the default site settings will be used.


## Changelog

* 1.0.0 - Initial release

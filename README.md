# MSMinimee

An ExpressionEngine Module that makes [Minimee 2+](https://github.com/johndwells/Minimee/tree/version2) fully MSM-compatible.


# Version 1.x (current BETA)

_Beta means be wary of using in production environments. Beta also means your feedback is hugely appreciated._


## Requirements:

* PHP5
* [ExpressionEngine 2](http://www.expressionengine.com)
* [Minimee 2+](https://github.com/johndwells/Minimee/tree/version2) (currently beta)


# Overview

MSMinimee is an ExpressionEngine Module that makes [Minimee 2+](https://github.com/johndwells/Minimee/tree/version2) fully MSM-compatible.

_This is not a replacement of Minimee 2+_; rather it extends it only where it needs to. This way I can develop the features & functionality of MSM support separate from the core of what Minimee does.


# Installation Instructions

* Be sure [Minimee 2+](https://github.com/johndwells/Minimee/tree/version2) is present in your system/expressionengine/third_party folder
* Copy the MSMinimee folder into your system/expressionengine/third_party folder
* Visit your Modules page and install MSMinimee


# Tag Usage

Use Minimee as normal, and if you have saved settings for a particular site, those will be used. Otherwise, the default site settings will be used.


# Changelog

* 1.0.0 - Initial release
